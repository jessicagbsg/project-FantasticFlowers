## About the project
This project was created to put to practice my knowledge in ``JavaScript ES6+``, to do so, all the events and ``DOM manipulation`` of this website were created without the use of frameworks or libraries. ``Git`` was used to keep track of the versioning, ``ESLint`` was used to find and fix pattern problems,   
``WebPack`` was used as module bundler, and ``Babel`` was used as transcompiler.


### Running the project
To run/open the project, you just have to download the "index.html" file and open it with your browser. 

To edit or make changes, you have to download the whole project folder and edit as you like with your favorite IDE.
